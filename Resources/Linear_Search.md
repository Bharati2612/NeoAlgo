# LINEAR SEARCH
It is a sequential method of searching a particular element within the given list of elements. The number is searched sequentially, one after another position in the given list. It works at worst linear time & make maximum of n comparisons.<br>
Example â€“<br> 
Given list : 3,2,8,4,6,9,1<br>
#### Best Case Scenario 
Element to be searched is 3<br>
No of comparison = 1 as 3 is present at the first position in the list to be searched.<br>
#### Average Case Scenario
Element to be searched is present in the middle , i.e 4<br>
We start from the first element i.e. 3, & finally we get 4 after 4 comparisons.<br>
#### Worst Case Scenario 
Element to be searched is 1<br>
We start comparisons from the first element in the list & move forward.<br>
No of comparisons = 7 as 1 is present at the 7th position in the list.<br>
## Time & Space Complexity of the Algorithm
#### Worst Case Time Complexity [ Big-O]: O(n) (when element to be searched is last in the list)
#### Best Case Time Complexity [Big-omega]: O(1) (when element to be searched is the first element in the list)
#### Average Time Complexity [Big-theta]: O(n/2) 
#### Space Complexity: O (1)
